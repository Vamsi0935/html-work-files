    <p align="justify">Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman FRS ( 7 November 1888 - 21 November 1970) was an Indian physicist
        known for his work in the field of light scattering.[2] Using a spectrograph that he developed, he and his
        student K. S. Krishnan discovered that when light traverses a transparent material, the deflected light changes
        its wavelength and frequency. This phenomenon, a hitherto unknown type of scattering of light, which they called
        "modified scattering" was subsequently termed the Raman effect or Raman scattering. Raman received the 1930
        Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery and was the first Asian to receive a Nobel Prize in any branch of
        science.</p>
